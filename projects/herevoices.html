            <p>Media solution for <span class="pbold">YleRadio</span>(Finlandâ€™s national broadcasting company) to capture the market of young people
                (15-30 year old). A solution was developed after conducting extensive user research, market study, ideation,
                prototyping and concept validation. Concept development revolved around high-school students who were ear-marked as the initial
                customer group and then the prototype was tested with a more diverse group of people. The project was done
                as coursework in <span class="pbold">Aalto University</span> for YleRadio under the guidance and mentoring of <span class="pbold">Fjord, Helsinki</span>.</p>
